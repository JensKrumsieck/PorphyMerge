# PorphyMerge
PorphyMerge is just a simple Console-App to merge all [PorphyStruct](https://github.com/JensKrumsieck/PorphyStruct)-Properties.json 
files into one csv-File to open it up in e.g. Excel. 

**Currently every Macrocycle has to be from the *same* type!**


Works with PorphyStruct Version >= 1.0.0 Beta 8

Structural Analysis of Porphyrinoids Molecular structures of porphyrinoid macrocycles can be represented by a linear combination of their vibrational normal modes. With PorphyStruct displacement diagrams can be generated and simulated to gain insight into the conformation of the obtained substance.
